===================================

===================================
This is a required file for all WordPress themes, so you can't just delete it.

USE OLD FASIONED CSS:
If you don't want to use SASS (or don't know what SASS is) - then you can go ahead
and just work in good, old-fashioned CSS within this very file.

TO USE SASS/COMPASS:
The _compass folder is a pre-configured Zurb Foundation Compass project.

Keep in mind that if you DO want to use SASS/Compass, you will still need to install 
the gems for Compass *and* the Zurb Foundation framework (even if you want to use 
a compiler like CodeKit). More info here: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/gem-install.php
